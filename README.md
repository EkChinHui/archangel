# tAngel 2016: Matching algorithm
## Author: Sriram Sami

### Overview
This year's algorithm uses a Hamiltonian-cycle based approach to finding valid angel-mortal chains. Critically, `networkx` was used for graph algorithms.

### Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment so that the required libraries don't pollute your namespace (Optional). Run `virtualenv venv` in the cloned directory.
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Put a header-less csv file with all details of participants in correct order in a file called playerlist.csv in the main folder.
5. Run `python angel.py`
